You agree to use the Communication Services only to post, send and receive messages and material that are proper and, when applicable, related to the particular Communication Service.</p>

                          <p>EVSU adheres to the basic principles of human decency, respect, and values. We do not allow for messages and comments that curse, trash, degrade, humiliate and intimidate. Freedom of speech does not mean a license to smear reputation and ruin credibility. Nor does it mean the freedom to be irresponsible and to defame. Freedom of speech, rather, is the recognition of the right of anyone to speak his or her mind and to express a contrary view without being objectionable.</p>

                          <p>EVSU, its partners and third-party providers have no obligation to monitor the Communication Services. However, it reserves the right to review materials posted to the Communication Services and to remove any materials and comments that violate standards of civility in its sole discretion  and the right to terminate your access to any or all of the Communication Services at any time, without notice, for any reason whatsoever.</p>

                          <p>Furthermore, EVSU reserves the right at all times to disclose any information as the University deems necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, or to edit, refuse to post, or to remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, in EVSU's sole discretion, without notice, for any reason whatsoever.</p>

                          <p>Be careful when posting or giving out any personal information about yourself, or your family in any Communication Services. EVSU, its developers, and third-party providers do not control or endorse the content, messages, or information found in any Communication Services and, therefore, it specifically disclaims any liability with regards to the Communication Services and any actions resulting from your participation in any Communication Services. Site managers and hosts have not authorized EVSU spokespersons, and their views do not necessarily reflect those of the University.</p>

                          <p>You are responsible for adhering to limitations on usage, reproduction, and/or dissemination if you download or upload materials to the Communication Services.</p>
